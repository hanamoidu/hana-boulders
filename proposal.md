# Title: 
Linking landscape-level processes and pool persistence in intermittent streams of central California

# Research Summary:
Intermittent streams occur globally and are especially common in arid regions, accounting for nearly 75% of the stream network in California. During dry periods, remnant pools act as critical habitats that support the persistence of biotic populations, from which they may recolonize surrounding habitats upon rewetting. The factors governing the occurrence of these remnant pools are largely unknown, although geology and geomorphology often result in the variable decoupling of stream pools from regional climate, allowing pools to persist under severe drought conditions. Given the importance of intermittent stream habitats for sustaining aquatic biodiversity, an improved understanding of the geomorphic controls on persisting pools is required. My research  is located at an intermittent stream in central California, which is strongly influenced by mass wasting events and landslide debris, which have deposited large boulders into the stream channel. Field observations indicate that the location of the large boulders (>3m in diameter) are associated with persistent pools. By linking boulder location and channel geomorphology with climatic data and biotic field measurements of remnant pools throughout the drying period, I aim to identify the landscape-level processes that sustain these unique habitat refugia in intermittent streams.

Proximity of boulders and other features to Coyote Creek



# Data description:
I currently have:

* Shapefile for the wet and dry reaches of Coyote Creek, an intermittent stream located in central California, for 2015-2017

* Shapefile for the boulder and bedrock distribution along the channel. I aim to determine whether these features influence the persistence of wet reaches even during dry periods.

# Analysis:
1. Determine the distribution of these features (presence in proximity of an isolated pool/wet reach through buffers)
2. Proximity of the features to boulders (spatial influence, Euclidean distance)
3. Whether the boulders are pool-sustaining or not ()

# Skills involved:
* Expanding use of spatial tools in R
* Using functions to repeat the analysis for all years with data (2014-2017)
